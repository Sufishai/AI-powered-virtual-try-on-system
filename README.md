# AI-powered-virtual-try-on-system
AI-powered virtual try-on system integrating OpenPose, Graphonomy, Detectron2, and HR-VITON to generate high-resolution, realistic clothing try-on images using computer vision and deep learning.
This project implements an end-to-end virtual clothing try-on pipeline using state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system performs human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, agnostic mask generation, and high-resolution garment transfer to realistically simulate how clothes fit on a person.

The pipeline integrates OpenPose for pose estimation, Graphonomy for human parsing, Detectron2 for segmentation support, and HR-VITON for final image synthesis. The project is designed for research, learning, and experimentation in fashion AI and virtual try-on systems.
